      <description>I was born and grew up in Sieradz, Poland. At 14, I moved to East Troy, Wisconsin, where I attended high school. Upon my graduation I moved to Madison which became my home for the next 8 years.In Madison I completed a bachelor&#39;s degree in Biochemistry and Polish. During my time as a badger, I had the opportunity to explore many of my interests, from foreign languages, through philosophy to hard sciences.</description>
